# Merge Sorted Arrays 
Description: in order to win the prize for most cookies sold, my friend Alice and I are going to merge ou Girl Scout Cookies orders and enter as one unit. Each order is representated by an "order id" (an integer). We have our lists of orders sorted numerically already, in lists. Write a function to merge our lists of orders into one sorted list.

Example (python3):
```python
my_list = [3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 15]
alices_list = [1, 5, 8, 12, 14, 19]

# Prints [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 19]
print(merge_lists(my_list, alices_list))
```
